# ZS-Data-Science-Challenge-2019
This is the solution to the problem of the first round of ZS Data Science challenge 2019

I used this approach and secured 133rd rank in ZS Data Science Challenge 2019 round1.
This model gave accuracy of **0.898** on Leaderboard.

NNFinal notebook is divided into two sections.

# Part 1
The intial part is data analysis where I have explored the data and gained insights on how the fill the missing values and what new features to generate.

# Part 2
This part focussed on imputing the missing values according to the inferences obtained in part1 and feature engineering. I used feed forward neural network for building the final model.

The predictions of the model can be found in NN_final.csv
